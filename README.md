# uijs-controls

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/uijs/uijs-controls.png)](http://travis-ci.org/uijs/uijs-controls)

This library contains some basic controls for uijs. It is bundled by default if you install 
the `uijs` module and contains some nifty stuff that can be used to build actual apps. 

To get started with __uijs__, see the 
uijs [README](https://github.com/uijs/uijs/blob/master/README.md).

See [organization](https://github.com/uijs/uijs/blob/master/doc/organization.md) for some info on what's here and what's elsewhere.

## Tests

To run tests:

    $ npm test
